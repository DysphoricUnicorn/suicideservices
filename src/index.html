        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          <b>There is no shame in needing help.</b><br />
          Life is difficult. Life is also worth living.<br />
          It is okay to not be okay. You deserve help.
        </p>
        <p>To make the search for help easier here is a short list of options.</p>

          <h3>Phone hotlines</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes you need to hear the voice of another human being to tell you that life will get better again.<br />
            Suicide prevention hotlines are usually free to call with volunteers who will listen to you.<br />
            If you think these could help you the
            <a href="http://www.suicide.org/search.html">search page on suicide.org</a>
            can be used to find a list of hotlines available where you live.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In times of mental crysis, it is usually <b>not</b> a good idea to call the police.<br />
            Police officers are not (well) trained to handle these situations and they can make things worse.<br />
            If someone you know is having suicidal thoughts and you want to help them, <b>do not call the cops without their consent.</b>

          <h3>Therapy</h3>
          <p>
            Many people require therapy and/ or medication to deal with their mental health issues.<br />
            <b>There is absolutely no shame in that either.</b><br />
            While therapy may not be able to help you immediately finding a professional who will help you is still a good idea. WebMD has
            <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/how-to-find-therapist#1">an article</a>
            detailing different kinds of therapy and how to find them.

          <h3>Social media</h3>
          <p>
            General social media is another thing that can both help and make things worse.<br />
            Especially social media sites made by large corporations are built to maximize time their users spend on them by exploiting the way our minds work.
          </p>
          <p>
            That does not mean that all social media is bad.<br />
            Mastodon is (simplified) a federated social network where anyone can set up a server and talk to others.<br />
            It is built to look and feel similar to Twitter but the timeline is chronological and you will only be shown posts by people you follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Joinmastodon.org</a> can help you find an instance with like-minded people to talk to.<br />
            Just note that not every instance listed there is well moderated. Take a look at the instance's public timeline to see if you want to join.

          <h3>Memes</h3>
          <p>
            Memes can be both life saving and life threatening.<br />
            For many, they are a valuable tool to talk about their feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, they can also lead to spiralling and many meme sites are also used by right wing extremists to find vulnerable people to recruit.<br />
            These extremists try to make people feel companionship while also subtily making them feel worse to make manipulation easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, it is important that meme sites used as a mental health resource are chosen carefully.<br />
            The
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/">wholesome memes subreddit</a>
            is a well moderated space that is focussed on sharing happy content.<br />
            It has helped me personally a lot before.
