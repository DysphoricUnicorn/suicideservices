# suicide(.)services

## Update

Because capitalism, I was unable to afford renewing the domain.  
Luckily you can still see it on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20211011133217/https://suicide.services/).

The repository is archived for now since the domain will probably be bought up by domain landlords as soon as it expires.

## Old readme

This is a small collection of help resources for people with suicidal thoughts.

It was created because I was gifted the domain name and wanted to put something useful on it.
